            <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I have always been interested in software development. When the opportunity arose to attend the 3 week Develop Coding course, I jumped at the chance. From this I grew even more passion for the subject, and decided I wanted to continue into a career as a software developer. After the 3 week course I aimed to get an apprenticeship through Code Nation. I was lucky enough to get a placement on a 15 month apprenticeship with a pledger company to continue my studies.  I now have skills in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HTML, JavaScript, React and Project Management. In the future I will be moving onto C# and SQL languages for my role at MPP Global. I also have a qualification in cyber security and digital forensics.</p>
